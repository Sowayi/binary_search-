# This is a readme file for binary_search function
the binaryis a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
it compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, 
the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining 
half until it is successful or the remaining half is empty. the binary_search function in this repo
is an implementation of this algorithm.
